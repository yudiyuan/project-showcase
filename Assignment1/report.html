        <h2>1. Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This project is a personal portfolio website designed to introduce myself, showcase my skills, and share my career aspirations. 
            It includes different sections such as "About Me", "Skills", "More About Me", and "Reflection & Future Plans".
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="container py-4">
        <h2>2. Design Process</h2>
        <p>
            Before implementing the website, I first sketched a boxified layout to plan the structure and organization of elements. 
            The design follows a responsive layout, ensuring that the website adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
        </p>
        <p>
            The page structure consists of a fixed navigation bar, a header section, and multiple content sections with distinct background colors to enhance readability.
        </p>

    <section class="container py-4">
        <h2>3. Technologies Used</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML5 - For structuring the webpage</li>
            <li>CSS3 - For styling and layout customization</li>
            <li>Bootstrap 5 - For responsive design and pre-built components</li>
            <li>Git & GitHub - For version control and online deployment</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="container py-4">
        <h2>4. GitHub Deployment</h2>
        <p>The website was deployed using GitHub Pages. The steps followed:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Created a public repository on GitHub named `Assignment1`.</li>
            <li>Initialized a Git repository locally and committed all files.</li>
            <li>Pushed the code to the GitHub repository.</li>
            <li>Enabled GitHub Pages in the repository settings.</li>
            <li>Deployed successfully at: <a href="https://your-github-username.github.io/Assignment1/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages Link</a></li>
        </ol>

    <section class="container py-4">
        <h2>5. Challenges & Solutions</h2>
        <p>During the development process, I faced the following challenges:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Issue: Ensuring that all sections were properly styled and aligned.</li>
            <li>Solution: Used CSS box model with `padding`, `margin`, and `border` for consistent spacing.</li>
            <li>Issue: Background colors did not change on small screens.</li>
            <li>Solution: Used a `@media` query to change section colors for mobile screens.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Future Improvements</h2>
        <p>
            In the future, I would like to enhance this project by adding:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>JavaScript interactions (e.g., animations, dynamic content updates)</li>
            <li>User feedback form to collect comments and suggestions</li>
