    <section id="about" class="container py-5">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I chose software development because I believe developing software is a meaningful and impactful endeavor. 
            Previously, I worked as an administrative assistant for two years, where my monthly tasks were almost identical, 
            and the workflows rarely changed. Every time I mechanically completed the same tedious tasks, 
            I wished I knew how to implement office automation to save a significant amount of time.
        </p>
        <p>
            That’s why I am most interested in office automation—I want to help more office workers reduce their workload. 
            I also find it fascinating to develop intelligent task management programs. 
            For instance, if new assignments are posted on the school’s website, Brightspace, 
            the system could automatically organize them based on course and due date, displaying all tasks in one place. 
            This would be incredibly helpful for students like me, who often worry about missing deadlines or being unaware of assignments.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of my greatest strengths is my habit of scheduling tasks and tracking the time spent on each one. 
            I regularly summarize my progress on a weekly basis and analyze long-term tasks, allowing me to clearly see my improvements. 
            I believe this is a valuable habit in the workplace as well, helping me stay organized and in control of all tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
            I aspire to become a Java developer, whether in a specialized tech company or a traditional industry. 
            Personally, I prefer experiencing different business sectors, as this broadens my knowledge and understanding of the world. 
            It also enhances my flexibility in applying coding skills across various domains.

        <!-- Inspiration -->
        <h4>Who Inspires Me</h4>
        <p>
            The person who inspires me the most is Elon Musk. He is a pragmatist who achieves great goals with the lowest possible cost.  
            His work in satellites and rockets has broken the long-standing monopoly of national governments in the aerospace industry,  
            making space technology more accessible to ordinary people and allowing more individuals to benefit from technological advancements.
        </p>
    
        <!-- Favorite Project -->
        <h4>My Favorite Project</h4>
        <p>
            My favorite project is a text-based mini-game that I have refined multiple times.  
            Although the programming concepts behind it are not yet very advanced, it already includes an "error correction mechanism" and runs stably.  
            My goal by the end of this semester is to improve its "class structure" to enhance code reusability and readability.  
            If you're interested, feel free to check it out!

        <h4>Current Representation</h4>
        <p>
            I believe this website is a good representation of who I am right now.  
            However, since I am constantly learning and improving, it can only serve as a "snapshot" of my journey at this moment in life.
        </p>
    
        <!-- Future Expansion -->
        <h4>Future Expansion</h4>
        <p>
            If I could expand this website, I would love to sync my daily schedule here.  
            This habit, which I started in 2021, has helped me achieve many goals,  
            such as earning an English certification and learning programming.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            As I continue to learn more about web development,  
            I hope to track website visits and preserve all past versions of my edits.  
            This way, everyone can see my growth and progress over time.
